							<h2 style="text-align:center">Project Overview</h2>
					   <p> This was a project I completed for my final year dissertation. I worked closely with members of the Keele University Sports Centre to design and create an app that would allow users to track how they divide up their time on any given day. Users would input data and then the app would generate a report for them with various graphs and statistics, followed by basic feedback and suggested improvements to their time expenditure habits </p>

						 <h3> <strong> User Requirements</strong> </h3>
						 <ul>
							 <li> The application must allow the user to <strong>track</strong> how much time they spent sitting,
								 		studying, sleeping, relaxing and exercising </li>
							 <li> The application shall <strong>visually display</strong> how the user has spent their time based on the
								 		information they have previously inputted </li>
							 <li> A basic form of <strong>analysis and feedback</strong> should be given on the userâ€™s data </li>
							 <li>The software should be <strong>easy for new users</strong> to use</li>
						 </ul>

						 <hr />

						<h3> <strong> Skills Developed</strong> </h3>

						<p> This project allowed me to further develop my coding abilities in Java with the help of Android Studio. The most challenging part was following specifications of an external client who wasn't proficient / knowledgeable in Computer Science and therefore meeting their expectations proved challenging at times. Many functions of the app, such as "providing user feedback" required alot of analytical thinking and creative approaches to successfully complete. </p>

						<p> Another major function of the application was to take inputted data from the user and visually display it in a meaningful way. This lead me to incorporating an SQLite database into the project to ensure that data was not lost when the application was closed of the phone. This allowed me to retrieve the data in future and use it to populate various graphs, with the most effective being a Pie chart. This also introduced countless areas for necessary user input validation
							to ensure that the app could not break at any point </p>
							<p>The application also had to be easy to use for regular university students which meant a "function over form" approach could not be taken. This taught me the importance of making basic app functionalities logical and easy to use for other people, and not assuming knowledge and skills on the users end.</p>
