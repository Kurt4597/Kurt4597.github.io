							<h2 style="text-align:center">Summary</h2>
					   	<p>My name is Kurt Cockayne and I am a 23 years old. I have recently graduated from Keele University achieveing an Upper Second Class (2:1) result in my Computer Science Degree. The entire journey was a new experience for me as it helped me discover my interest in programming and
							 	 left me wanting pursue a career in Software Development. I am eager to continue learning and further progressing my skills, as I know my journey into programming has only just begun! </p>

						<h3><strong>Hobbies</strong> </h3>
						 <ul>
							 <li><strong>Health and Fitness</strong> - Regular exercise and keeping myself healthy has always been a priority for me. I believe that being physically fit has a large influence on the quality of work that an individual can produce and it is something which is overlooked by many people in today's society. On any given week I attend the gym up to five separate times, a habit which
							  	has not only helped my physically but also helped me develop my self discipline. </li>
							 <li><strong>Technology</strong> - A lifelong interest in technology and computers has always driven me to continue learning about them. I am specifically interested in how we are able to use phones, computers and other devices to benefit our life. This is what sparked my initial interest for programming, seeing people make basic programs to perform tasks for them was something which I found fascinating.
