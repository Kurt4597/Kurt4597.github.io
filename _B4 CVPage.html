						<h3><strong>Practical Skills</strong></h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Project Management </strong> - Ability to plan, produce and deliver large projects. This was most evident after creating and delivering an Android Mobile application for an external client as a final year dissertation project. This emphasised the importance of communicating with clients to establish clear, defined goals and further utilising them to help navigate the subsequent stages of project development. It also expanded my interpersonal skills through continuous in-person meetings with the client and various focus groups during testing stages of the application. A first-class grade was awarded for this project </li>
							<li><strong>Collaboration Work</strong> - Studied modules such as Software Engineering Project Management and System Lifecycles and Design which primarily focussed on group-based presentations and assignments. I received first-hand experience working with others and actively presenting my own strengths whilst also welcoming contributions from others, a strategy which proved to be great success. I also gained insights into how crucial effective communication, both written and verbally, is to achieve any goal when working with a team </li>
							<li><strong>Analytical Skills</strong> - Continuous problem-solving challenges across A-levels and University has helped me create a strong foundation of core analytical skills. A key strength of mine is being able to interpret given data and using it to make decisions in a timely, efficient manner. This helped me succeed in A-level Mathematics and Economics exams, as well as being a useful tool throughout projects at University. More specifically, when testing and evaluating applications that I had developed for different modules, I would present them to large groups of users in order to gather data for testing and user feedback. Being able to effectively interpret and integrate this data into my work played a key role in achieving my results </li>

							<h3><strong>Technical Skills</strong></h3>
							<ul>
					 			<li><strong>Programming</strong> - After studying several programming-based modules which built upon basic problem-solving skills, I have developed a more comprehensive understanding of the programming concepts and the principles of widely used data structures and algorithms in object-oriented languages. As a result of this, I have experience with, and am able to produce applications using Java, C# and Python </li>
								<li><strong>Advanced Web Technologies</strong> - Acquired the skills necessary to develop multi-tier web applications and configure the servers on which these applications rely. Gained experience with web development and using languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Combining all these languages to create functioning websites improved my overall knowledge of how secure web applications work whilst still paying attention to the smaller details. I have since utilised these skills to create my own online portfolio, the linked to which is provided above </li>
							  <li><strong>Database Systems</strong> -	Experienced with creating databases and database management systems to be able to store and retrieve relevant data. Established a strong understanding of Database Management concepts and the various technologies involved, such as Oracle and SQL Databases </li>
